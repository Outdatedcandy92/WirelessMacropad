# Wireless Macropad

## What am I making?

I'm making a wireless macropad that can be screwed into the side of any desk. the macropad can be powered by AA batteries as it features and onboard buck boost convertor.

## Time Spent Overall: 2 Hours


# 31 July - Speedrun time

So its 10pm right now and I have two hours to finish this

I started with my schematics first, I went with a ESP32 C3 supermini as its small and I've used it before, I also put my sliding pot footprint on it and a bbuck boost convertor design that I used in a different project

Heres the schematic result

The PCB design was pretty simple and here it is (not much to say tbh)

After this I imported the PCB into fusion 360 and started moddeling a case around it, I went with a 2mm plate that has screw holes so I can screw my PCB securly or you know worst case I can just plate mount it as I made the plate cutouts on the top plate of the pcb.
I made the plate and bottom of the PCB two different parts and added screw holes in order to secure them.

I also added screw holeso n the bottom and then added another 5mm thick long part thingy, which is basically what will screw onto the desk/ wherever you mount it, I made it detachable in case you don't want to mount it.

Here's the CAD final cad

And yes thats its I speedran ts in under 2 hours (almost 2 hours lol)
